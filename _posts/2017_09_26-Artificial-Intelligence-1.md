### Assignment 1: My thoughts and current point of view

In the course of studying for my bachelor degree I took a two-class-course in artificial Intelligence (A.I.). For our first assignment, and as a small step in, we received the task to read through two articles (I'll provide the links below) revolving around the subject, to form our own thoughts, questions and vision and write these down in a blog so that we can review them at the end of the course. The goal being that we can compare how our views will change over the course of the semester.

The topic of A.I. has always been one of great interest for me. Thus most of the topics handled in the articles wasn't news to me. Even though they did provide some new and interesting views to me. 
A.I. is and has been throughout its history a very controversial topic. I am personally in the rather optimistic corner. A.I., when it emerges, will be the technology which will bring the largest change to our society. 

One thing that was interesting was the differentiation of the different levels of A.I.

**Narrow Artificial Intelligence (ANI)**

ANI defines the type of A.I. that has already entered into our lives in various ways. This includes voice recognition programs, autonomous cars, chess programs and so on.

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**

This describes A.I. which has a general human level of "intelligence". These types of A.I. could be compared to the likes of [C-3PO from Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-3PO) or [Cortana from Halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_%28Halo%29) which are both generally not more intelligent than humans but enjoy the benefits of high processing power (which is way above that of a human).

**Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)** 

The next as well as last step on the A.I. ladder is the so called Superintelligence. A Superintelligence is an A.I. which surpasses humans every single way. The would have way higher processing power than humans, find solutions to problems humans don't even know exist and generally operate in a way that we wouldn't be able to really understand. Examples for this would include [the Minds from Ian Bank's Culture series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_%28The_Culture%29).

#### The future: Glorious utopia or extinction (or the wish for it)?

The most controversial part about A.I. is without doubt the question of whether it will benefit us and bring humanity to unforeseen heights or bring about the end of the human race. 
As depicted in many works of fiction the advent of a A.I. can play out really badly for us, either enslaving humanity (e.g. The Matrix, I have no mouth and I must scream) or outright trying to exterminate them (Terminator). Other works of fiction show that a Superintelligence could fulfill all of our desires and needs and would basically make us immortals living in a post scarcity society (The Culture).

I am rather inclined towards the optimistic corner and think that the invention of A.I. will enable us to solve many of the problems we are currently facing and bring about a never before seen prosperity. 

In my opinion the difficulties coming towards us lie in how we will program these first A.I. I do have concerns regarding the safety and operation limits we will put into these programs. I personally think that we will need to develop rules similar to the [Three Laws of Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics) defined by Isaac Asimov which would act as a sort of "moral compass" and ensure that our creations couldn't harm us. It has been shown that defining a full set of rules for that purpose is actually really difficult. The above mentioned three laws were later complemented by another "zeroth" rule. 

But even then it will prove difficult since machines and A.I. will likely not think like a human but instead rigidly follow their implanted rules. 

Another huge issue I see will be how we handle such AGI or ASI regarding laws and rights. If such an intelligence emerges it is likely that it might contain something akin to a consciousness. How these new "beings" will stand in social aspects compared to humans is a whole other topic which could lead to conflict as seen in the [Overwatch Universe](http://overwatch.wikia.com/wiki/Omnic_Crisis). 

#### Conclusion

I believe that we will eventually develop AGI and likely even ASI and that these will bring with them a lot of improvements and benefits for humanity. Nevertheless it is of utmost importance how we develop A.I. and that we take every precaution we possible to ensure that the biggest leap for humanity doesn't end with missing the landing and falling down a chasm.
