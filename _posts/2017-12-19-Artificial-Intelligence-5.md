### Assignment 5: One semester later...

Fourteen weeks have passed now and I am nearing the end of the regular semester. Our initial task in the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) course was to write a blog post about our views and expectations regarding A.I. partially reflecting our already existing views as well as our thought regarding two blog posts we had to read beforehand. 
So now after having had 14 weeks of interesting lectures and learning a lot of new things about how A.I. currently works and how people try to further its development.

Similar to the first task, we also had to read [a post about the topic](http://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai). I did not read it.
