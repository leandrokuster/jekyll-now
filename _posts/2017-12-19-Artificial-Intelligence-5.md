### Assignment 5: One semester later...

Fourteen weeks have passed now and I am nearing the end of the regular semester. Our initial task in the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) course was to write a blog post about our views and expectations regarding A.I. partially reflecting our already existing views as well as our thought regarding two blog posts we had to read beforehand. 
So now after having had 14 weeks of interesting lectures and learning a lot of new things about how A.I. currently works and how people try to further its development.

Similar to the first task, we also got a post to read [a post about the topic](http://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai). I did not read it fully but the gist of it was about what "mistakes" are common when people make predictions about the future of A.I.

My view hasn't really changed from when I wrote the first post. I still believe that we will eventually develop AGI or even ASI. Nevertheless I couldn't give you a precise year or even a narrow range of years when we will be likely to achieve this. 

What I learned during this course was how extremely complex and especially time-consuming the training of A.I. is today. It also became clear to me how important the learning models are when trying to train our A.I. and while it is easy to make a model for simple sorting tasks (e.g. at an assembly-belt) it is something completely different when talking about teaching a machine emotions or when trying to teach a machine compelex and abstract concepts of the real world.
