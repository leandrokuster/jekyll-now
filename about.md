Welcome to my github blog about the topic of Artificial Intelligence. 

### Who am I?

I'm a student currently in my 5th semester studying towards a bacherlor degree in computer sciences. 

### About this blog
I took the a lecture on the topic of artificial intelligence (A.I.) in which we got the task to create a blog. The main reason is so that we can write down our view on A.I. at the beginning of the semester and then come back at the end to compare it. 

If I feel like it, and find the time, I might also make some posts about the topics we are discussing.
